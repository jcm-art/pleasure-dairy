## Developing for Pleasure Dairy ESP32

### Developing with VS CodeÂ 

To start developing on the ESP32 with VS Code, install [PlatformIO](https://docs.platformio.org/en/stable/integration/ide/vscode.html#ide-vscode). PlatformIO is an open source ecosystem for IoT development. It supports more than 900 development boards along with more than 20 development platforms. PlatformIO is available as an extension for Visual Studio Code (also called VS Code) from the Microsoft Visual Studio Marketplace.

An example of a basic applicatin for the ESP32 using platform IO is [here](https://docs.platformio.org/en/stable/tutorials/espressif32/arduino_debugging_unit_testing.html).
