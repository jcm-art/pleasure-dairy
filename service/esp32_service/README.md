ESP32 Based Lighting Service
========================


# Introduction and Documentation

## ESP32 Background

The ESP32 is a microcontroller with more memory, flash storage, and processing power than the arduino. It also has built in wifi and bluetooth. 

The pinout for the ESP32 is [here](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-pinout-reference-gpios/).

## Using the ESP32 Based Lighting Service



## Developing for Pleasure Dairy ESP32

### Developing with VS CodeÂ 

To start developing on the ESP32 with VS Code, install [PlatformIO](https://docs.platformio.org/en/stable/integration/ide/vscode.html#ide-vscode). PlatformIO is an open source ecosystem for IoT development. It supports more than 900 development boards along with more than 20 development platforms. PlatformIO is available as an extension for Visual Studio Code (also called VS Code) from the Microsoft Visual Studio Marketplace.

An example of a basic applicatin for the ESP32 using platform IO is [here](https://docs.platformio.org/en/stable/tutorials/espressif32/arduino_debugging_unit_testing.html).
